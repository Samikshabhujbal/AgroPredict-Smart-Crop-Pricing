AgriPrice Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the prices of various agricultural commodities based on historical market data. The dataset used in this project includes information on different commodities, their variety, grade, market, and region, along with their minimum, maximum, and modal prices.

This project demonstrates the following key steps:

Data loading and preprocessing of agricultural price data.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
Building machine learning models to predict future commodity prices based on historical trends.
Visualization of data insights and model predictions using Python libraries like pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
The goal of the project is to provide insights into price fluctuations of crops, helping stakeholders in agriculture (e.g., farmers, traders) make informed decisions.
